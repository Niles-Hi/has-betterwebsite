				Dear HAS Community,<br>
​				<br>
				I am extremely excited about the 2016-2017 school year, as well as moving <br>
				forward in the future. Not only is this our 12th year, the school continues <br>
				to undergo steady improvement in the areas of instruction, extra-curricular <br>
				activities, and facilities. I am certain this will be one of the best years <br>
				in the history of the Hsinchu American School.<br>
				​<br>
				Our Principal, Mr. Anthony Donnelly, and Vice-Principal, Mrs. Lindsey Kruger,<br> 
				create a dynamic duo of academic administrators who will oversee and facilitate <br>
				an excellent program for our students. We also have a professional and experienced <br>
				teaching staff to provide the best of instruction. Miss Sonia, along with our fine <br>
				office staff, will continue to provide excellent service to our parents and students <br>
				as well.<br>
				 <br>
				We are currently in the second year of a six-year WASC accreditation period and are <br>
				looking forward to our interim visit next spring. Gaining full accreditation was an <br>
				arduous process, but we are all proud of the outcome. Mr. Donnelly will be representing <br>
				our school both at EARCOS this fall and on a WASC visiting team to Mongolia in March.<br>
				I want to assure everyone that I am still here and will continue to work hard to reach <br>
				the goal that the Chairman, Mr. Yeh, and I established more than eight years ago: to create <br>
				the best international school in Taiwan and one of the best schools throughout all of Asia.<br>
				 <br>
				Let’s all work together to realize our school’s mission and vision.<br>
				<br>
				Sincerely,<br>
				Darin L. Murphy<br>
				Superintendent/Head of School<br>
