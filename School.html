				Hsinchu American School is a school focused on preparing students for the constantly changing 
				climate of the 21st century. <br> The school provides a university preparatory program, for international 
				students, using an American-based curriculum. The school offers <br> a rotating schedule of Advanced Placement 
				courses and places a great deal of importance on all of our courses, allowing advanced <br> students to 
				enroll in higher level courses based on ability, as a means of propelling them to greater academic heights. Hsinchu 
				American <br> School also strives to provide students with a strong foundation in the classic liberal arts, to 
				enhance their abilities in the four C’s (critical thinking <br> , communication, collaboration and creativity), and 
				to furnish students with multiple opportunities for experiential learning. HAS is intent upon <br> help its students 
				become global citizens, critical thinking, and lifelong learners. The program’s focus is to create young adults 
				who can draw upon <br> a plethora of knowledge and skills necessary for life-long success in the modern world.

				Hsinchu American School’s Schoolwide Learner Goals – the LGs – have emerged from the vision and mission that were <br> 
				originally created as foundation and framework for the school. These distinguishing skills and habits of mind and action
				not only support students in <br> achieving academically, but also in self-directed and continual learning, problem solving 
				and adaptation. <br> Since their original establishment in the fall of 2011, the LGs have been continuously reviewed, analyzed,
				and revised by all stakeholders in the school community. <br> They have been most recently revised in the fall of 2013 after 
				multiple sources of input culminating in a set of three areas for student development. <br> The following are the program’s 
				overall school-wide learner goals (LGs):
