				Dear H.A.S. Family:<br>
​				<br>
				It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the 2016 – 2017 school <br>
				year at Hsinchu American School (HAS). This is our 12th year of existence <br>
				and we are very excited about our many upcoming plans and initiatives.<br>
				​<br>
				We pride ourselves on offering a unique educational experience that delivers <br>
				a high degree of instruction in the math and sciences, but that also emphasizes <br>
				the importance of establishing a strong foundation in the liberal arts and the <br>
				benefits of experiential learning. Our program is created with the goal of shaping <br>
				our students into individuals who are prepared to succeed in the rapidly changing <br>
				landscape of the 21st century.<br>
				​<br>
				I am well aware of the importance of our position and being trusted with shaping the <br>
				valuable resource of young minds. I feel we have an excellent program that our dedicated <br>
				staff has worked rigorously toward creating and we are constantly improving.<br>
				 <br>
				This is my 5th year at HAS and I have seen incredible effort from the staff in that time.<br>
				This is our second year of being officially accredited with the Western Association of Schools <br>
				and Colleges (WASC). This is a big achievement and has been a school-wide initiative involving <br>
				many areas of improvement, including facilities (new library, offices, more electronics) and <br>
				academic improvements (strong curriculum, unit plans, selection and use of standards, developing <br>
				common assessments, and many more).<br>
				 <br>
				We also have a wide variety of new facilities that we are working on. We will have our <br>
				own sports facility this year, which will include a soccer field and a full-sized basketball <br>
				court that can also be used for volleyball. Additionally, we have expanded down one floor <br>
				in our middle school building and are opening a lot of student-focused rooms, such as a <br>
				student lounge and work area, a weight room, a room to practice musical performances, and <br>
				a middle school art room.<br>
				 <br>
				We are also promoting the use of RENWEB, which is a comprehensive Learning Management <br>
				System. This has allowed students and parents to track assigned homework, homework <br>
				submissions and grades. It has also resulted in much better communication between parents <br>
				and teachers.<br>
				 <br>
				We have many other initiatives we are working toward this year. We hope to promote greater <br>
				student involvement in extra-curricular activities, resulting in more active students with <br>
				multiple skill sets. We are also unveiling common assessments in all core subject areas. <br>
				Using the results of these assessments, and other data collected from sources such as student <br>
				work and parent and student surveys, we are planning on developing a comprehensive data <br>
				committee and system that will help track student progress and development and benefit us in<br>
				informing instruction. Finally, we are offering additional ESL courses in the middle school <br>
				and high school to help with English language learning.<br>
				 <br>
				I am very proud to be an HAS Wolf and am looking forward to a safe and productive year. <br>
				These are exciting times for everyone here and I am looking forward to sharing them with you all.<br>
				 <br>
				Sincerely,<br>
				Mr. Donnelly<br>
				Principal<br>
